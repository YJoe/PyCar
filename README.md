The code for a mini car idea that I put on youtube a while ago!

I have not looked at this code for a long time and to be honest I think it will be quite bad! I have since gotten much better at programming and I would love to see what you think of some of my newer projects on a few friends and mine's youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoPoyh-bRjmdOpplEYZEDg?view_as=subscriber
